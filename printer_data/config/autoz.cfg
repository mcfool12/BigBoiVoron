[z_calibration]
nozzle_xy_position: 120, 355
#   A X, Y coordinate (e.g. 100,100) of the nozzle, clicking on the z endstop.
switch_xy_position: 114, 334
#   A X, Y coordinate (e.g. 100,100) of the probe's switch body, clicking on
#   the z endstop.
bed_xy_position: 175, 175
#   A X, Y coordinate (e.g. 100,100) where the print surface (e.g. the center
#   point) is probed. These coordinates are adjusted by the
#   probe's X and Y offsets. The default is the zero_reference_position which
#   replaces the deprecated relative_reference_index
#   of the configured bed_mesh, if configured. It's possible to change the zero
#   reference position at runtime or use the GCode argument BED_POSITION of CALIBRATE_Z.
switch_offset: 0.535
#   The trigger point offset of the used mag-probe switch.
#   A larger value will position the nozzle closer to the bed.
#   This must be determined manually. More on this later
#   in this section..
offset_margins: 1.0
#   The minimum and maximum margins allowed for the calculated offset.
#   If the offset is outside these values, it will stop!
#   The margin can be defined as "min,max" e.g. "-0.5,1.5" or by just one
#   value e.g. "1.0" which translates to "-1.0,1.0" (which is also the default).
speed: 150
#   The moving speed in X and Y. The default is 50 mm/s.
probing_first_fast: false
#   If true, the first probing will be faster by the probing speed.
#   This is to get down faster and not record the result as a
#   probing sample. The default is false.
start_gcode: Attach_Probe
#   A list of G-Code commands to run before each calibration command.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for the G-Code format. This can be used to
#   attach the probe.
end_gcode: Dock_Probe
#   A list of G-Code commands to run after each calibration command.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for the G-Code format. This can be used to
#   detach the probe afterwards.
